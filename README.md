# oshoe
This is a repository to collect documents related to automating the manufacturing process related to custom one-off orthotic shoes (and footwear in general)

The goal is to design software and hardware to "automate" the customization of shoes (especially the outsole, which is not really being done) using 3D printing and other computer controlled manufacturing technologies.

For a list of Tasks we are working on: https://github.com/orgs/other-realm/projects/2/views/1
